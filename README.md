# Signature
Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted to include a picture of your signature in a document, but were held back due to this?

That's where `Signature` comes in. Using python, we built a simple utility that does the job. Take a look!

## Using Locally

### Before Running (Assuming you have pip, git and an appropriate version of python)

* If you're not worried about breaking anything in your environment:
    * On Windows:
        * Run `pip install -r win_requirements.txt`
    * On MacOS/Linux:
        * Run `pip install -r unix_requirements.txt`

* Otherwise, if you're trying to install the dependencies individually:
    * Run `pip install numpy`
    * Run `pip install Pillow`
    * Run `pip install opencv-python`
    * Install Kivy. Refer to the relevant OS instructions [here](https://kivy.org/#download)

**Note:** For develoment and testing, we used `Python 3.7.x`, `Pillow 7.2.0`, `Open CV 4.3.0.36`, and `Numpy 1.19.0`.

### Running

In your terminal, navigate to the project folder you cloned and run:

`python main.py`

The command assumes python3 is aliased to python. On Windows if you only have Python 3.x installed the aliasing should be done for you, but on Linux you would have be more explicit depending on the distro and its version. So, if the command above fails try:

`python3 main.py`

We do plan on launching an `exe` for the this utility in a future release!
