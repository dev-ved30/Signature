# Signature


## Using Locally

### Before Running (Assuming you have pip and git)

On Windows, run the following in `cmd`

* Run `pip install numpy`
* Run `python3 pip install Pillow`
* Run `pip install opencv-python`

If you're using a linux distro, you might need to install `tkinter`

*Note:* For develoment and testing, we used `Pillow 7.1.2`, `Open CV 4.2.0`,`Python 3.7.4` and `Numpy 1.18.4`.

### Running

For now, users will need to run the code inside an IDE. For our testing, we used `Visual Studio Code` with the Python extension.

We do plan on launching an `exe` for the this utility in a future release!
