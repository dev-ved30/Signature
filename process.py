def shadow_crusher(im_arr):
    """
    This function takes the numpy LA array of an image and removes the shadows.
    It returns a normalised image in the form of an array.

    Modifications to the greyscale channel are made in-place.

    Steps:

    Extract: Extract the greyscale channel and perform the following on it.

    Dilation: This uses pixel clusters to dilate the channel. It replaces the
    parts of the channel where content appears with white squares that are 7 by 7
    pixels which helps remove the content while preserving the shadows.

    Median Blur: This blurs or smoothens the dilated channel. As a result,
    the places from where the content is removed do not appear to be
    pixelated. The aperture size is 21.

    Absolute Difference: This compares the orignal channel with the blurred one,
    pixel by pixel. If the difference between those is 255, which it would be for
    pixels containing content, diff_image is assigned the value 0, which would make
    those pixels black. Else, the pixel will get a whiter shade due to the difference.

    Normalize: Normalizes the channel to use the entire 8 bit range. alpha is the lower
    boundary while beta is the upper one. It makes light parts of the image lighter and
    dark part darker. This makes it easier to work with higher thresholds in the
    process_signature function.

    Set: Set the image's greyscale channel equal to the normalized channel

    Args:
        img (Numpy array): Image for which that shadow needs to be removed

    Returns:
        Numpy array: Normalized Image with the shadows removed or flattened.
